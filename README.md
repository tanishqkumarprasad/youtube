**Approach,**
The design and development of this Youtube app UI were guided by the following objectives:

1) As the Youtube's UI is accesible by everyone. I simply copied the UI in my project.
2) I downloaded the thumbnails and titles of the videos that is on the recommended page of youtube app.
3) Brick by brick I nearly replicated the youtube's user interface.

**Challenges Faced**
Throughout the development of the app UI, I encountered several challenges:

1) Complex Layouts: Designing a responsive layout that adapts well across different screen sizes was tricky.
2) Custom Widgets: Creating custom widgets, posed a challenge in terms of performance and smooth rendering.
3) Design Language: Ensuring that the app has consistent styling, such as color schemes, typography, and padding across different screens, was a challenge.


**Improvements I Would Make**
1) Support for user authentication.
2) Improved performance.
3) Currently, the app UI is static. In the future, I would integrate a backend service.
